Nest is the repo for a Discord Bot named Birb, Birb was designed to be an "everything bot", i.e does everything that you/a discord server owner could need. Currently the bot is being rewritten to be more stable inside of the discord.py rewrite and have features that are of a higher quality than what preceeded it! (Again, I know...)

```shell
pip install -r ./requirements.txt # Install requirements
